## Firefox PNG Icon Collections
Contained in this repository is a collection of folders. Each folder contains multiple sized PNG images for a Firefox base icon designed by artists around the world.

### Why?
This is useful for creating icons with badges, or without a badge, for your operating system. One tool designed to help you with this is the Firefox Addon "Icon Container Generator" found at [AMO :: Noitidart / Icon Container Generator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/icon-container-generator/).

### Missing Sizes
Each folder contains a readme file. It credits the artist, and links to their work.

Ideally each folder should contain 10 images of the sizes: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 512, and 1024. If any are missing they will be indicated in a table in the readme of that folder.

If you like that icon please help complete that set by clicking on the link to the artist's work and then sending them a message. I have tried but they usually don't respond until many people request for it. You should ask the author to share the missing sizes at high resolutions. An SVG file would be nice as well if they can provide it.

### SVG
On Linux, if you can provide an SVG that is perfect. Otherwise it is not necessary, simply provide the sizes need for the platform.

However if the author can share the SVG of his icon this is best, because then any of the other sizes can then be generated at high resolution.
